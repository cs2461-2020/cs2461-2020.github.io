CedarLogic is a great tool for building and simulating digital logic circuits. However, **CedarLogic does not run on Mac**. Mac Users, see the [Logisim tutorial](logism_tutorial.md) for an alternative. 

- Download CedarLogic [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cedarlogic/) 
- Watch this tutorial on CedarLogic basics here [TODO: video]

**Warning**: Sometimes CedarLogic crashes unexpectedly, so make sure you save frequently!
