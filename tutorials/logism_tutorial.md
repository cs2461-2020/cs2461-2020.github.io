title: Logism Instructions 
---

Logisim is a great tool for building and simulating digital logic circuits. For Mac users, Logisim is a great alternative to CedarLogic, though Logism can run on Windows and Linux as well. 


- Download Logisim [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/circuit/)
- Watch a short demo on Logism basics [here](https://youtu.be/rQOv0h-4TEo)
- **Note**: If you have a Windows computer, we suggest using [CEDAR Logic](cedarlogic_tutorial.md) instead 

- For more help with Logism, see these tutorials and resources:
