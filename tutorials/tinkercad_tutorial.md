Tinkercad is a free online tool that allows you to easily design and simulate circuits. This tool encompasses all of the capabilities and components that you would typically come across while building hardware circuits.

### Getting Started ### 
Join the CSCI 2461 Tinkercad classroom [here](https://www.tinkercad.com/joinclass) by inputting the class code for your lab section and your assigned ‘nickname’. **Your nickname is your GW username (before @gwu.edu)**. Class codes are as follows: 
- Lab Section 30 (Wednesday) : **L8I8SP9GWVAU**
- Lab Section 31 (Friday) : **NVIGZ9EMPY51**
- Lab Section 32 (Thursday) : **83WXUZJPJX9Z**

Once you are logged in to Tinkercad, you can begin creating circuits which instructors will automatically be able to view and simulate

### Tinkercad Circuit Features ### 
- To create a new circuit while logged in, navigate to ‘Circuits → Create New Circuit’
- In the sidebar on the right side of the screen, you can search for components (such as “gate”, “LED”, “breadboard”) and drag them into your workspace
- To rotate elements in your workspace, click on the component you wish to rotate and press ‘r’ on your keyboard 
- To change resistance of resistors in your workspace, simply click on them and enter the correct resistance and units
- Similarly, to change the color of LEDs or wires, click on the component and select the color in the pop-up dropdown bar
- To simulate your circuit, click ‘Start Simulation’ in the upper righthand corner. While your circuit is simulating, you can interact with it by clicking buttons and flipping switches to determine outputs   
- You do not need to manually save your circuits. They will automatically update in your online workspace so you can come back to them and edit later on. In the upper right hand corner of your workspace, you can check the 'saved' status of your circuit before you exit
- To share your circuit with an instructor or group member, click ‘Share’ in the upper righthand corner and input their email address to enable editing
